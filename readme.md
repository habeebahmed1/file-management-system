#File Management System

## About:-

This is a simple file management system which can be used to create separate folders with different format files.
In this system I use packages like OS and Shutil

Packages required:

import os :- This packages provides portable way of using operating system dependent functionality .
If you just want to read or write a file see open()


import shutil :- The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations 
on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided 
which support file copying and removal. For operations on individual files

Get the input from the user to save files in there respective file format folders
